# Project Name

A concise description of your project.

## Overview

This project provides a codebase that integrates WebAssembly with a Go runtime environment using a custom implementation of `wasm_exec.js`. It serves as a demonstration of file system operations within a WebAssembly context and can be used as a starting point for further development.

## Features

- WebAssembly integration with Go.
- Custom file system emulation for standard I/O operations.
- Lightweight and extendable code structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd yourproject
    ```
3. Install any dependencies (if applicable) using your package manager.

## Usage

Include the `wasm_exec.js` script in your project. This script sets up a basic file system interface to handle output via WebAssembly modules.

For example, load the script in your HTML file:
```html
<script src="wasm_exec.js"></script>
```

Compile your Go code to WebAssembly and then run:
```
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to your branch and create a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

- [The Go Authors](https://golang.org/) for their work on Go and the original wasm_exec.js.
- Community contributions that make this project possible.
## Setup

Execute the following commands in your terminal to build the WebAssembly module and run the server:

```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" .
go run server.go
```
## About Fractal

Fractal is a creative coding project that explores pattern generation through geometric shapes. Currently, the project focuses on generating random line patterns within triangular boundaries, laying the foundation for more complex fractal-based designs.

### Current Features
- Random line generation
- Triangle-based boundary system
- Real-time pattern rendering

### Future Development
We plan to expand the pattern generation to include:
- True fractal-based patterns
- Multiple geometric shape support
- Color schemes and gradients
- Interactive pattern controls
